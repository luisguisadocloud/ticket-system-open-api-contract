## üìñ Overview

This repository serves as an educational example demonstrating how to create a comprehensive OpenAPI contract following the OpenAPI specification. The contract defines a **Serverless Ticket System API** designed to be implemented with AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

This project is part of a didactic approach to teach API-First development principles using Swagger Editor as the primary tool for design and validation.

## üéØ Purpose

The main objectives of this repository are:

- **Educational**: Demonstrate best practices for OpenAPI contract design
- **API-First Approach**: Show how to design APIs before implementation
- **Documentation**: Provide a complete, well-documented API specification
- **Validation**: Showcase proper error handling and response schemas
- **Security**: Demonstrate JWT Bearer token authentication patterns

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The API is designed for a serverless architecture with the following characteristics:

- **Backend**: AWS Lambda functions
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway for request routing
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer token authentication
- **Data Format**: JSON for all requests and responses
- **Status Tracking**: Comprehensive ticket lifecycle management

## üîß API Components

### Core Resources

#### Ticket Management
The API revolves around **Ticket** entities, which are digital records used to track and manage support requests, problems, or incidents.

**Ticket Status Lifecycle:**
- `NEW` ‚Üí `OPEN` ‚Üí `IN_PROGRESS` ‚Üí `RESOLVED` ‚Üí `CLOSED`

**Ticket Priority Levels:**
- `LOW` ‚Üí `MEDIUM` ‚Üí `HIGH` ‚Üí `CRITICAL`

**Ticket Types:**
- `INCIDENT` - Technical issues or problems
- `SERVICE_REQUEST` - Service requests or feature requests
- `QUESTION` - General questions or inquiries

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Status Codes |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `POST` | `/v1/tickets` | Create a new ticket | 201, 400, 401, 500 |
| `GET` | `/v1/tickets` | List all tickets | 200, 401, 500 |
| `GET` | `/v1/tickets/{id}` | Get ticket by ID | 200, 400, 401, 404, 500 |
| `PUT` | `/v1/tickets/{id}` | Update ticket (total replacement) | 200, 400, 401, 404, 500 |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/tickets/{id}` | Update ticket (partial update) | 204, 400, 401, 404, 500 |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/tickets/{id}` | Delete ticket | 204, 400, 401, 404, 500 |

### Data Models

#### Request Schemas
- **CreateTicketRequest**: Required fields for ticket creation (title, description, reporterId)
- **UpdateTicketRequest**: Complete ticket update with all required fields
- **PatchTicketRequest**: Partial ticket updates (any combination of fields)

> **üîí Security Note**: In a production environment, the `reporterId` field should not be included in the request payload. Instead, it should be automatically extracted from the JWT token's user context to prevent impersonation attacks. The current specification includes `reporterId` in requests for educational purposes and API contract completeness, but real implementations should derive this value from the authenticated user's identity.

#### Response Schemas
- **TicketResponse**: Complete ticket information including:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
  - `title`: Brief title describing the issue (1-50 characters)
  - `description`: Detailed description (1-250 characters)
  - `status`: Current status (NEW, OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, RESOLVED, CLOSED)
  - `reporterId`: UUID of the user who reported the ticket
  - `assignedToId`: UUID of the assigned agent (nullable)
  - `priority`: Urgency level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
  - `type`: Ticket category (INCIDENT, SERVICE_REQUEST, QUESTION)
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp when ticket was created
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp when ticket was last updated
- **ListTicketResponse**: Array of tickets
- **ErrorResponse**: Standardized error format with code, message, and optional details

### Security

The API implements **JWT Bearer token authentication**:
- All endpoints require authentication
- Tokens must be provided in the `Authorization` header
- Format: `Bearer <token>`

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error responses for different scenarios:

| Error Type | Code | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `UnauthorizedError` | 401 | Missing or invalid token |
| `NotFoundError` | 404 | Resource not found |
| `BadRequestError` | 400 | Invalid input data or malformed UUID |
| `InternalServerError` | 500 | Unexpected server error |

**Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "code": "bad_request",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "details": [
    "Title is required and must be between 1 and 50 characters",
    "Description is required and must be between 1 and 250 characters",
    "Reporter ID must be a valid UUID format"
  ]
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools
